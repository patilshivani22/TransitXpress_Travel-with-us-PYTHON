# TransitXpress_Travel-with-us-PYTHON
This is a Pyhton based GUI application where different libraries are used to built this application.
TransitXpress is a local bus information application travelling in city(Kolhapur, Sangli, Jaysingour, Sanjay Ghodawat University, Ichalkarnji).
As there is no such application for MSRTC local bus for local everyday travelling people, College student this application will help with Bus time, name, ticket etc.
This whole application is built using PyQt5 and excel for bus information.
